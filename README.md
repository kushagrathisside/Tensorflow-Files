- 🐱‍💻 To provide students who are beginning their journey with Tensorflow with some basic codes which they use for playing with architecture and attributes. 
- 🎠 This can be considered as a *toy notebook* to play with tensorflow. This will make the beginners more friendly with Tensorflow so that they can understand concepts well.
- 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 To use this repository as a teaching aid in my bootcamp.

1. All contributors are invited to contribute to this repository by providing their beginner content(documentation or notebooks), which can be used as an open sourced beginner guide for Tensorflow. 
2. Also, as mentioned above this is not for *displaying your knowledge* in Deep Learning or Tensorflow so avoid making changes that won't help beginners, rather confuse them. We already have a Tensorflow documentation for them.
3. For existing files, do check if any issue already exists. Create one only if it is unnoticed.
